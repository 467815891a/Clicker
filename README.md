This program records all key- and mouse inputs. 

## General
The log can be saved as .csv file and later on imported again. It can be edited by editing the WaitTime column, or deleting rows/the log. The WaitTime column specifies the time in seconds before the row will be executed. Changing the default WaitTimes for keyboard and mouse seperately is also possible. Changing the default WaitTimes update all WaitTimes which are equal to the current default value.

## To-do
- Find out how to register a change by a user in the table. Now, a signal is sent when a cell is selected; changing a value does not automatically update the log itself, first another cell has to be selected.
- Change row height, can be more compact.
